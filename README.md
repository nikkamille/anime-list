# AnimeList

Welcome to my Anime List CLI! You can search for any anime shows or movies to get more information. I hope you enjoy using my CLI application. :)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'anime_list'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install anime_list

## Usage

1. Type in the command that you want to do. You can type 'search' to search for a specific anime or 'exit' to close the program.
2. When you type 'search', the application will ask you to type ONE word from the anime title that you want to search. You can only one word.
3. The CLI application will show you a list of all animes with that word. Choose from the list and type the Anime ID number to learn more about a specific anime.
4. The application will go back to the main menu. You can search again or exit the program.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
